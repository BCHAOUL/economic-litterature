# Early economic writings
I started this project because I think it might be interesting to explore early economics writings. The idea is to understand the logic that was dominant in early economic writings. On of the goals of this project is to compare the ideas of the founders of modern economics as a discipline.

What is exciting for me is to use Python, webscraping and NLP techniques to properly conduct a project.

Here's a list of what I would like to touch in the project :

Making graphics (e.g. wordcloud)
Using deep learning NLP techniques
Compare early writers to contemporeanous writers
