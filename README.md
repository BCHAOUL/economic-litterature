# Early economic writings
I started this project because I think it might be interesting to explore early economics writings. The idea is to understand the logic that was dominant in early economic writings. On of the goals of this project is to compare the ideas of the founders of modern economics as a discipline.

What is exciting for me is to use Python, webscraping and NLP techniques to properly conduct a project.

Here's a list of what I would like to touch in the project :

Making graphics (e.g. wordcloud)
Using deep learning NLP techniques
Compare early writers to contemporeanous writers

# Texts used for the project

All the texts I am going to use come from the [Project Gutenberg website](https://www.gutenberg.org/wiki/Main_Page). Project Gutenberg was founded by Michael Hart in 1971 with the goal of providing free electronic books and ebooks. It contains over 60,000 ebooks that are available in many format including plain text, HTML or ebook. 

For this project, I am interested in analysing early economic writings. For that purpose I am going to query the following books : 
- [An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations by Adam Smith](https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3300)
- [On The Principles of Political Economy, and Taxation by David Ricardo](https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/33310)
- [The Condition of the Working-Class in England in 1844](https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17306)
- [Principles of Political Economy by John Stuart Mill](https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/30107)
- [The General Theory of Employment, Interest, and Money](http://gutenberg.net.au/ebooks03/0300071h/printall.html), Taken from Gutenberg Australia

The following books weren't available on the Project Gutenberg site,   
so I found them on the Online Library of Liberty website :
- [Alfred Marshall, Principles of Economics (8th ed.) [1890]](https://oll.libertyfund.org/titles/marshall-principles-of-economics-8th-ed)
- [Karl Marx Capital A Critique of Political Economy Volume I Book One: The Process of Production of Capital](https://oll.libertyfund.org/titles/marx-capital-a-critique-of-political-economy-volume-i-the-process-of-capitalist-production)
- [Ludwig von Mises, Human Action: A Treatise on Economics, vol. 1 (LF ed.) [1996]] (https://oll.libertyfund.org/titles/mises-human-action-a-treatise-on-economics-vol-1-lf-ed)
