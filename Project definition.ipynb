      "[\"This book is chiefly addressed to my fellow economists. I hope\\r\\nthat it will be intelligible to others. But its main purpose is\\r\\nto deal with difficult questions of theory, and only in the\\r\\nsecond place with the applications of this theory to practice.\\r\\nFor if orthodox economics is at fault, the error is to be found\\r\\nnot in the superstructure, which has been erected with great care\\r\\nfor logical consistency, but in a lack of clearness and of\\r\\ngenerality in the pre misses. Thus I cannot achieve my object of\\r\\npersuading economists to re-examine critically certain of their\\r\\nbasic assumptions except by a highly abstract argument and also\\r\\nby much controversy. I wish there could have been less of the\\r\\nlatter. But I have thought it important, not only to explain my\\r\\nown point of view, but also to show in what respects it departs\\r\\nfrom the prevailing theory. Those, who are strongly wedded to\\r\\nwhat I shall call 'the classical theory', will fluctuate, I\\r\\nexpect, between a belief that I am quite wrong and a belief that\\r\\nI am saying nothing new. It is for others to determine if either\\r\\nof these or the third alternative is right. My controversial\\r\\npassages are aimed at providing some material for an answer; and\\r\\nI must ask forgiveness If, in the pursuit of sharp distinctions,\\r\\nmy controversy is itself too keen. I myself held with conviction\\r\\nfor many years the theories which I now attack, and I am not, I\\r\\nthink, ignorant of their strong points. \", 'The matters at issue are of an importance which cannot be\\r\\nexaggerated. But, if my explanations are right, it is my fellow\\r\\neconomists, not the general public, whom I must first convince.\\r\\nAt this stage of the argument the general public, though welcome\\r\\nat the debate, are only eavesdroppers at an attempt by an\\r\\neconomist to bring to an issue the deep divergences of opinion\\r\\nbetween fellow economists which have for the time being almost\\r\\ndestroyed the practical influence of economic theory, and will,\\r\\nuntil they are resolved, continue to do so. ', \"The relation between this book and my Treatise on Money\\r\\n[JMK vols. v and vi], which I published five years ago,\\r\\nis probably clearer to myself than it will be to others; and what\\r\\nin my own mind is a natural evolution in a line of thought which\\r\\nI have been pursuing for several years, may sometimes strike the\\r\\nreader as a confusing change of view. This difficulty is not made\\r\\nless by certain changes in terminology which I have felt\\r\\ncompelled to make. These changes of language I have pointed out\\r\\nin the course of the following pages; but the general\\r\\nrelationship between the two books can be expressed briefly as\\r\\nfollows. When I began to write my Treatise on Money I was\\r\\nstill moving along the traditional lines of regarding the\\r\\ninfluence of money as something so to speak separate from the\\r\\ngeneral theory of supply and demand. When I finished it, I had\\r\\nmade some progress towards pushing monetary theory back to\\r\\nbecoming a theory of output as a whole. But my lack of\\r\\nemancipation from preconceived ideas showed itself in what now\\r\\nseems to me to be the outstanding fault of the theoretical parts\\r\\nof that work (namely, Books III and IV), that I failed to deal\\r\\nthoroughly with the effects of changes in the level of\\r\\noutput. My so-called 'fundamental equations were an instantaneous\\r\\npicture taken on the assumption of a given output. They attempted\\r\\nto show how, assuming the given output, forces could develop\\r\\nwhich involved a profit-disequilibrium, and thus required a\\r\\nchange in the level of output. But the dynamic development, as\\r\\ndistinct from the instantaneous picture, was left incomplete and\\r\\nextremely confused. This book, on the other hand, has evolved\\r\\ninto what is primarily a study of the forces which determine\\r\\nchanges in the scale of output and employment as a whole; and,\\r\\nwhilst it is found that money enters into the economic scheme in\\r\\nan essential and peculiar manner, technical monetary detail falls\\r\\ninto the background. A monetary economy, we shall find, is\\r\\nessentially one in which changing views about the future are\\r\\ncapable of influencing the quantity of employment and not merely\\r\\nits direction. But our method of analysing the economic behaviour\\r\\nof the present under the influence of changing ideas about the\\r\\nfuture is one which depends on the interaction of supply and\\r\\ndemand, and is in this way linked up with our fundamental theory of value. We\\r\\nare thus led to a more general theory, which includes the\\r\\nclassical theory with which we are familiar, as a special case. \", \"The writer of a book such as this, treading along unfamiliar\\r\\npaths, is extremely dependent on criticism and conversation if he\\r\\nis to avoid an undue proportion of mistakes. It is astonishing\\r\\nwhat foolish things one can temporarily believe if one thinks too\\r\\nlong alone, particularly in economics (along with the other moral\\r\\nsciences), where it is often impossible to bring one's ideas to a\\r\\nconclusive test either formal or experimental. In this book, even\\r\\nmore perhaps than in writing my Treatise on Money, I have\\r\\ndepended on the constant advice and constructive criticism of Mr\\r\\nR.F. Kahn. There is a great deal in this book which would not\\r\\nhave taken the shape it has except at his suggestion. I have also\\r\\nhad much help from Mrs Joan Robinson, Mr R.G. Hawtrey and Mr R.F.\\r\\nHarrod, who have read the whole of the proof-sheets. The index\\r\\nhas been compiled by Mr D. M. Bensusan-Butt of King's College,\\r\\nCambridge. \"]\n"
